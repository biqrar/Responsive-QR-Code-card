### What I learned

Designing QR-code card using Bootstrap 5 made this project pretty easy, with Bootstrap pre tags you can finish this project quickly, and responsive. it requires less style in style.css sheet.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

````html
<div
  class="card mt-2 rounded-3 shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-body rounded"
  style="width: 18rem"
>
  ``` ```css .container { max-width: fit-content; max-height: auto; margin-top:
  25px; padding-bottom: 50px; display: flex; align-items: center;
  justify-content: center; background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%); }
</div>
````

this help me bring the card to middle of page. and style it as mentioned in the guide.
